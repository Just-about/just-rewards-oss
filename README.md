# Just Rewards ◢◢

Welcome to Just Rewards, a feature of [Just About](https://justabout.com) that makes earning rewards even easier.

## Purpose

By sharing the Just Rewards codebase, we aim to:

1. Demonstrate our commitment to transparency
2. Foster trust with our members
3. Show some of our development practices and code quality

## Transparency

While this is not an open-source project in the traditional sense, we believe in the value of code transparency.
This repository allows interested parties to review our code, understand our methodologies, and gain insights
into how we approach the development of Just Rewards.

## Security

We take the security of Just Rewards seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within the code,
please do not disclose it publicly. Instead, send a description of the issue to [dev@justabout.com](mailto:dev@justabout.com).
We appreciate your effort to make Just Rewards more secure and will address all legitimate reports promptly.
